# Adding Aspects to Code

An aspect has no effect until it is applied to some element of code. PostSharp provides multiple ways to add aspects to your code.


## In this chapter

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| <xref:multicast> | This section shows how to add aspects to code using custom attributes and explains how you can target several declarations with a single line of code |
| <xref:xml-multicasting> | This section shows how to add aspects without modifying your source code, by using an external configuration file. |
| <xref:iaspectprovider> | This section describes how to add aspects programmatically (by writing code that is executed at build-time) and overcome limitations of declarative approaches. |
