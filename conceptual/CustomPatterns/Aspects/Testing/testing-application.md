# Testing that an Aspect has been Applied

In the previous section, we have seen how to test the aspect behavior itself. Now, let's see how we can test that the aspect has been applied to the expected set of targets. This can also be called *testing the pointcut*. 


## Why test that the aspect has been properly applied?

You may need to test whether an aspect has been applied to specific targets for one of the following reasons:

* The aspect is applied using non-trivial regular expressions with <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.MulticastAttribute>. 

* The aspect is silently filtered out using <xref:PostSharp.Aspects.MethodLevelAspect.CompileTimeValidate(System.Reflection.MethodBase)>. 

* The aspect is applied using an <xref:PostSharp.Aspects.IAspectProvider>. 


## Testing that the aspect behavior is exhibited

The most obvious way to test that the aspect has been applied to an element of code is to execute that code and ensure that the code actually exhibits the aspect behavior. This approach does not differ from the one described in section <xref:simple-tests>. 


## Testing that the aspect custom attribute is present

You can check that an aspect has been applied to a target by reflecting the custom attributes present on this element of code.

However, custom attributes representing aspects are stripped by default. If you want PostSharp to emit custom attributes, follow instructions of section <xref:multicast-reflection>. 

> [!NOTE]
> Aspects added by <xref:PostSharp.Aspects.IAspectProvider> are not represented by custom attributes, so their presence cannot be tested by this approach. 


## Parsing the PostSharp symbol file

PostSharp generates a symbol file named *bin\Debug\MyAssembly.psssym*, where *MyAssembly* is the name of the assembly. In theory, you could use this file to determine which elements of code have been modified by aspects in your project. 

> [!CAUTION]
> The PostSharp symbol file format is undocumented and unsupported. It means that PostSharp support team cannot answer questions related to this file format.
