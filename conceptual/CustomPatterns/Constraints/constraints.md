# Validating Architecture

Besides aspect-oriented programming, you can use PostSharp to validate your source code against architecture and design rules named *constraints*. Constraints are piece of codes that validate the code against specific rules at build time. 

PostSharp provides ready-made constraints for the following scenarios:

* <xref:control-implementation>
* <xref:control-visibility>
Additionally, you can develop custom constraints to enforce your own design rules. For details, see <xref:custom-constraints>.
