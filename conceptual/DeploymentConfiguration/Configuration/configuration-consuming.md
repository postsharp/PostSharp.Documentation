# Accessing Configuration from Source Code

Even if most configuration settings are consumed by PostSharp or its add-in, it is sometimes useful to access configuration elements from user code. The *PostSharp.dll* library gives access to both configuration properties and extension configuration elements. 


## Accessing properties

You can read the value of any PostSharp property by including it in an XPath expression and evaluating it using the <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.IProject.EvaluateExpression(System.String)> method of <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.PostSharpEnvironment.CurrentProject>: 

```csharp
string value = PostSharpEnvironment.CurrentProject.EvaluateExpression("{$PropertyName}")
```

For details regarding expressions, see <xref:configuration-xpath>. 


## Accessing custom sections

You can get a list of custom sections of a given name and namespace by calling the <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.IProject.GetExtensionElements(System.String,System.String)> method of <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.PostSharpEnvironment.CurrentProject>: 

```csharp
IEnumerable<ProjectExtensionElement> elements = 
     PostSharpEnvironment.CurrentProject.GetExtensionElements( "MyElement", "uri:MyNamespace" );
```

Extension elements must be declared using the [sectiontype](configuration-system#sectiontype) element.
