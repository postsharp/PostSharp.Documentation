# Deployment

PostSharp has been designed for easy deployment in typical development environments. Over the years, source control and build servers have become the norm, so we optimized PostSharp for this deployment scenario.

In most situations, PostSharp should work just fine without any advanced configuration. This chapter includes a detailed description of all deployment and configuration scenarios.
