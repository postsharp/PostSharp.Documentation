# Deployment and Configuration

This part describes how to deploy and configure PostSharp in complex situations.

Although PostSharp is very intuitive to use and get started with in small projects, large teams and regulated environments have specific challenges that are addressed here.

You can typically skip the reading of this part if you just want to get started quickly with PostSharp, then come back when you decide to deploy it at a larger scale.

This part is composed of the following chapters.

| Chapter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| <xref:deployment> | This chapter describes how to install, uninstall and upgrade PostSharp, how to register license keys and to cope with build servers. |
| <xref:licensing> | This chapter addresses a few technical questions regarding licensing, license keys and license servers. |
| <xref:configuration> | This chapter explains configuration settings and how to modify them. |
