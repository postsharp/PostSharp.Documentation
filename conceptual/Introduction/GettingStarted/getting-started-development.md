# Developer Role: Using Aspects

Using aspects requires much less training than creating new ones. In typical large teams, only a few developers or architects develop new aspects, while the rest of the team uses existing aspects. This section focuses on the skill set that you need to acquire if you have to be able to use PostSharp aspects but don't need to create your own.

In this session, we also assume that PostSharp has been properly deployed into your development and build environments.

> [!NOTE]
> Of course, you can learn PostSharp as much as you want. The role of this section is to provide a short list of articles to minimize your learning curve and get you productive as quickly as possible, but this should not stop you from learning and experimenting more.


## Installing and upgrading PostSharp

Every process has a starting point. Learn how to add PostSharp to your project so that you can get started with improving your codebase.

## Working with pre-built patterns

PostSharp offers a number of different pre-built patterns. You will need to learn those that will be used in your application.
