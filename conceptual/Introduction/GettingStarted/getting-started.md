# How to Learn PostSharp

A PostSharp implementation project is typically composed of three phases, in which three roles typically interact differently with the product. Each role requires different skills and knowledge. We have created a learning path for each of these roles. Depending on your team's organization, you may be involved in one or more roles.

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| <xref:getting-started-architecture> | In the first phase, the team learns about the concepts and abilities of PostSharp, and identifies how it could fit into the application's design and architecture. The team selects the ready-made aspects that will be used in the application and, when no ready-made aspects can be used, it creates custom aspects or architecture rules.<br>People in this role are typically called architects, technical leads or senior developers. They must acquire an extensive knowledge of PostSharp and their decisions affect the whole team's productivity. |
| <xref:getting-started-deployment> | The next typical step is to deploy PostSharp into your development infrastructure and configure licensing. PostSharp works mostly out of the box for individual developers and small teams, but you may want some planning if you are responsible for a complex solution. |
| <xref:getting-started-development> | Your team is finally ready to use PostSharp on a daily basis. At this point, typically, the team already knows which aspects will be used and when and how they will be used. As a developer who will *use* existing aspects, you don't need to invest a large amount of effort to learn PostSharp upfront. However, you will need to understand the aspects that have been selected by the team, and how to apply them to a code base.  |
