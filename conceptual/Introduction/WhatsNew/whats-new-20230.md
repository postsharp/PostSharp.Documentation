# What's New in PostSharp 2023.0

PostSharp 2023.0 brings support for .NET 7.0 and C# 11.

PostSharp Tools for Visual Studio is now side-by-side compatible with Metalama. Actions in the refactoring menu and the solution explorer will no longer propose to install PostSharp features in a project in which PostSharp has not previously been installed.

The following Microsoft platforms are no longer in mainstream support. Although we did not explicitly specifically remove the supporting code, we will no longer support them:

* .NET Core 5.0

* Visual Studio 2017 (PostSharp Tools is not published for this version anymore)

* Visual Studio 2019 before 16.11
