# What's New in PostSharp 2025.1

PostSharp 2025.1 brings an update of licensing terms and support for building PostSharp from source code on Docker for qualifying Enterprise users.

# Product consolidation
To simplify the product lineup, the following products are no longer available separately:

* PostSharp Logging is now included in PostSharp Framework.
* PostSharp MVVM, Caching, and Threading are now exclusively part of PostSharp Ultimate.

For users with existing license or subscription for these products nothing changes. Existing subscriptions can be renewed and new users can be added as needed.

# Source-available and private build

Qualifying enterprise users can request access to https://github.com/postsharp/postsharp by contacting support.

PostSharp releases are located in branches with a `release` prefix. For example, the version 2025.1 has its source code under `release/2025.1` branch.

See README.md in the cloned repo for details about requirements and build instructions. These instructions are likely to change in future versions.

Currently only public NuGet package build using Docker is supported and all other operations are without support.
