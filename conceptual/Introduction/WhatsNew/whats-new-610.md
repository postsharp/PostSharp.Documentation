# What's New in PostSharp 6.10

PostSharp 6.10 brings support for .NET 6.0, Visual Studio 2022, and C# 10.

The following Microsoft platforms are no longer in mainstream support. Althought we did not explicitly specifically remove the supporting code, we will no longer support them:

* .NET Core 2.1

* Visual Studio 2019 before 16.4
