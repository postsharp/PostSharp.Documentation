# What's New in PostSharp 6.9

In PostSharp 6.9, we focused solely on improving the performance of our Visual Studio tooling.

We completed our migration to the async APIes of modern Visual Studio versions. We also optimized the code for the versions of Visual Studio we currently support, because it still contained some legacy from older versions.
