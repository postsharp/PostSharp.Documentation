# Adjusting Logging Verbosity

Sometimes when an issue happens in production, you will want to enable tracing for a specific type or namespace dynamically, without rebuilding the application. To prepare for this scenario, you need to add as much logging as is reasonable at build time, but disable it by default at run time, and then enable it selectively.

You can configure verbosity at run time using an XML configuration file or programmatically, using an API. You can store the XML configuration file online and specify an auto-reload interval.

You can also configure the logging verbosity differently for each request or transaction.

This article shows how to configure verbosity with a configuration file. You can also change it programmatically. For details, see <xref:logging-verbosity-api>. 


## Configuring logging verbosity

Thanks to the *PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Configuration* package, you can modify your logging verbosity policies dynamically without redeploying or even restarting your application. All you have to do is to author an XML file, to store it online with public access (preferably under a secret URL), and to call the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LoggingConfigurationManager.ConfigureFromXmlWithAutoReloadAsync(PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LoggingBackend,System.Uri,System.TimeSpan,System.Threading.CancellationToken)> method. Note that you can also configure verbosity from a local file or without automatic reload using the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LoggingConfigurationManager.ConfigureFromXml*> method. 


### To configure logging verbosity with auto reload:

1. Add the *PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Configuration* package to your top-level project (the one with the `Program` class). 


2. Create a logging verbosity configuration file based on the example below. It first defines the default logging level to be `warning` by default, but `debug` for the `Foo` namespace and `trace` for the `Foo.Bar` class. Note that the order of the `source` elements are important: a record overrides the previous ones for anything under its namespace. 

    ```xml
    <logging>
        <verbosity level='warning'>
    		<source name='Foo' level='debug' />
    		<source name='Foo.Bar' level='trace' />
    	</verbosity>
    </logging>
    ```

    For details regarding this file format, see <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Transactions.Model.LoggingConfigurationModel>. 


3. Store this file on any file service offering HTTPS access.

    > [!SECURITY NOTE]
    > Note that the XML file can contain code that will execute on the device from which you call this method. One cannot exclude the possibility for a malicious attacker to create file that would cause breaches of data or denial of service. Therefore, you must ensure that only authorized personnel have access in writing to the remote file. Additionally, this file must be publicly accessible in reading. Therefore, it should not include any sensitive piece of information (there should be no reason to do so).


4. Finish the configuration of your back-end by calling <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LoggingConfigurationManager.ConfigureFromXmlWithAutoReloadAsync(PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LoggingBackend,System.Uri,System.TimeSpan,System.Threading.CancellationToken)> . 


5. Run your application and check the error logs. Mistakes in the policy file will not throw exceptions into your application but report errors to your logs.



## Configuring per-request or per-transaction logging

PostSharp Logging makes it so easy to add logging to your application that you can easily end up capturing gigabytes of data every minute. As it goes, most of this data won't ever be useful, but takes a performance overhead, and you still need to pay for storage and bandwidth. The ability to trace an application at a high level of detail is very useful, but only if you are be able to select *when* you want to log. 

For instance, if you are running a web application, it is probably useless to log every single request with the highest level of detail, especially for types of requests that are served 100 times per second. Therefore, it is important to be able to decide, at run-time, which requests need to be logged. You may choose to disable logging by default and to enable logging for select requests only. We call that *per-request* or, more generally, *per-transaction* logging. 

The first thing to do is to define transaction boundaries in your application. Here is how to enable this with the new and the old ASP.NET. To define your own transaction type, see <xref:custom-logging-transactions>. 


### To enable per-request logging for ASP.NET Core:

1. Add the *PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.AspNetCore* package to your top-level project (the one with the `Startup` class). 


2. In your `Program.Main` method, call the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Adapters.AspNetCore.AspNetCoreLogging.Initialize(PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Correlation.ICorrelationProtocol,System.Predicate{Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpRequest},PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.LogEventMetadata)> method: 

    ```csharp
    AspNetCoreLogging.Initialize();
    ```


3. Define per-transaction logging in your logging verbosity configuration file and set the `type` attribute of the `/logging/transactions/policy` element to `AspNetCoreRequest`, for instance: 

    ```xml
    <logging>
        <verbosity level='warning'/>
        <transactions>
            <policy type='AspNetCoreRequest' 
                    if='t.Request.Path.StartsWith("/invoices")' 
                    name='Policy1'>
                <verbosity>
                    <source level='debug'/>
                </verbosity>
            </policy>
        </transactions>
    </logging>
    ```



### To enable per-request logging for the legacy IIS-based ASP.NET:

1. Add the *PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.AspNetFramework* package to your top-level project (the one with the `Startup` class). 


2. Add <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Adapters.AspNetFramework.PostSharpLoggingHttpModule> as an HTTP module in your *Web.config* file. 

    ```xml
    <configuration>
    	<system.webServer>
    		<modules>
    		  <add name="PostSharpLogging" type="PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Adapters.AspNetFramework.PostSharpLoggingHttpModule"/>
    		</modules>
    	</system.webServer>
    </configuration>
    ```


3. Define per-transaction logging in your logging verbosity configuration file and set the `type` attribute of the `logging/transactions/policy` to `AspNetFrameworkRequest`, for instance: 

    ```xml
    <logging>
        <verbosity level='warning'/>
        <transactions>
            <policy type='AspNetFrameworkRequest' 
                    if='t.Request.Path.StartsWith("/invoices")' 
                    name='Policy1'>
                <verbosity>
                    <source level='debug'/>
                </verbosity>
            </policy>
        </transactions>
    </logging>
    ```


The policy files above (which are identical except the transaction type) first define the default logging level to be `warning`, the verbosity is raised to `debug` for all incoming HTTP requests whose path start with `/invoices`: 

The most interesting part of the example above is the `if` attribute. This is a C#-like expression that takes a parameter `t` of type <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Transactions.Model.OpenTransactionExpressionModel`1> and must return a `bool`. <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Transactions.Model.OpenTransactionExpressionModel`1> is a generic type. The type of its <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Transactions.Model.OpenTransactionExpressionModel`1.Request> property is determined by the value of the `type` attribute of the `policy` element: 

* For `AspNetCoreRequest`, the type is <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Adapters.AspNetCore.AspNetCoreRequestExpressionModel> 

* For `AspNetFrameworkRequest`, the type is <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Adapters.AspNetFramework.AspNetFrameworkRequestExpressionModel> 

* For custom transactions, see <xref:custom-logging-transactions>. 

The `if` attribute is interpreted using [Dynamic Expresso](https://github.com/davideicardi/DynamicExpresso), an expression engine that emulates C#. It accepts the functions defined in the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Transactions.Model.TransactionPolicyExpressionFunctions> class (which you must use without type prefix). The <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Transactions.Model.TransactionPolicyExpressionFunctions.Matches(System.String,System.String)> function allows you to match a string against a regular expression. 


## Configuring sampled logging

In the example above, all requests that match the `if` expression would be assigned the same logging verbosity. That could mean hundreds of requests per second. Instead of logging all requests that match a given predicate, you can choose to log only a fraction of them. This can be done with the `sample` attribute. In this attribute, you would typically call one of these sample functions: <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Transactions.Model.TransactionPolicyExpressionFunctions.Random(System.Double)> or <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Transactions.Model.TransactionPolicyExpressionFunctions.OnceEveryXSeconds(System.Double,System.String)> 

The following policy file defines two transaction policies: the first catches a random 10% sample of all ASP.NET Core requests whose path starts with `/invoices`, and the second catches maximally 1 request per minute for all requests whose path starts with `/orders`. Both transactions raise the verbosity to `debug`, but only for those transactions. 

```xml
<logging>
    <verbosity level='warning'/>
    <transactions>
        <policy type='AspNetCoreRequest' 
                if='t.Request.Path.StartsWith("/invoices")' 
                sample='Random(0.1)' 
                name='Policy1'>
            <verbosity>
                <source level='debug'/>
            </verbosity>
        </policy>
        <policy type='AspNetCoreRequest' 
                if='t.Request.Path.StartsWith("/orders")' 
                sample='OnceEveryXSeconds(60, t.Request.Path)' 
                name='Policy2'>
            <verbosity>
                <source level='debug'/>
            </verbosity>
        </policy>
    </transactions>
</logging>
```
