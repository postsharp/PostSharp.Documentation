# Undo/Redo

Most business application users are familiar with applications that have the ability to undo and redo changes that they have made. Itâ€™s not common to see this functionality in custom built applications because it is quite difficult to do. Despite this difficulty, undo/redo is consistently mentioned on the top of users' wish list.

The <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Recording.RecordableAttribute> aspect makes it much easier to add undo/redo to your application by automatically appending changes done on your object model to a <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Recording.Recorder> that you can then bind to your user interface. Unlike other approaches to undo/redo, the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Recording.RecordableAttribute> aspect only requires minimal changes to your source code. 


## In this chapter

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| <xref:undoredo-start> | The first step is to make your model classes recordable. This section shows how to add the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Recording.RecordableAttribute> aspect to the model classes to enable the undo/redo functionality.  |
| <xref:undoredo-ui> | This section describes how to expose the undo/redo functionality to the application's users. |
| <xref:undoredo-operation-name> | This section shows how to group changes into logical operations and give them a name that is meaningful to the application's users. |
| <xref:undoredo-recorder> | This section explains how to customize the assignment of recordable objects to recorders. |
| <xref:undoredo-callbacks> | This section shows how to execute custom logic when undo/redo operations occur in a recordable object. |
| <xref:undoredo-conceptual> | This section describes the concepts and architecture of the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Recording.RecordableAttribute> aspect.  |
