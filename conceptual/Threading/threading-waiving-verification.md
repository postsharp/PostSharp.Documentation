# Opting In and Out From Thread Safety

By default, PostSharp enforces thread safety for all instance fields and all public and internal methods of any class to which you applied a threading model.

However, there are times when you want to opt-out from this mechanism for a specific field or method. A typical reason is that access to the field is synchronized manually using a different mechanism.

This section shows how to override the default thread safety implemented by PostSharp.


## Opting out from thread-safety verification for a method

To disable enforcement of the class-level threading model for a specific method, add the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Threading.ExplicitlySynchronizedAttribute> attribute to that method. 

In the following example, this custom attribute allows us to implement the `ToString` in a class that respects the Actor model. Without the custom attribute, this would not have been possible because non-void public methods must have the `async` keyword. 

```csharp
[Actor]
class Player          
{
   private readonly string name;

   [ExplicitlySynchronized] 
   public override string ToString()
   {
      return this.name;
   }
}
```

When used on a method, the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Threading.ExplicitlySynchronizedAttribute> attribute has several effects: 

* Lock-based aspects such as <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Threading.SynchronizedAttribute> or <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Threading.ReaderWriterSynchronizedAttribute> will not attempt to acquire a lock before executing this method. 

* Accesses to fields are not verified during the whole execution of the method (for the current thread).

* All build-time verifications are disabled for this method.

> [!WARNING]
> By using the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Threading.ExplicitlySynchronizedAttribute> custom attribute, you are significantly increasing the risk that multithreading defects in user code go undetected by PostSharp. Code using <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Threading.ExplicitlySynchronizedAttribute> should be more carefully covered by reviews and tests. 


## Opting out from thread-safety for a field

To disable enforcement of the class-level threading model for a specific field, add the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Threading.ExplicitlySynchronizedAttribute> attribute to the field: 

```csharp
[Actor]
class MyActor
{

  [ExplicitlySynchronized]
  int counter;

  public void FooBar()
  {
    // This line would throw an exception without [ExplicitlySynchronized].
    Task.Factory.StartNew(() => Interlocked.Increment( ref this.counter ));
  }
  
}
```

When used on a field, the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Threading.ExplicitlySynchronizedAttribute> attribute has several effects: 

* Accesses to the field are never verified

* All build-time verifications are disabled for this method.


## Opting in for thread safety for callback methods

By default, thread safety is ensured when a thread first invokes a public or internal method of an object. The underlying motivation is that public and internal methods are the primary way how a thread can enter an object. Another way is to enter an object through a delegate call to a private method. By default, PostSharp does not ensure thread safety for private methods. If you register a callback method, you need to add the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Threading.EntryPointAttribute> custom attribute on this method. 

In the following code snippet, the `OnCreated` method is invoked from a background thread by the `FileSystemWatcher` class. The `InputQueueWatcher` is thread-safe thanks to the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Threading.SynchronizedAttribute> aspect. 

```csharp
[Synchronized]
class InputQueueWatcher         
{
  FileSystemWatcher watcher;
  
  [Child]
  AdvisableCollection<string> files = new AdvisableCollection<string>();
  
  public InputQueueWatcher(string path)
  {
    this.watcher = new FileSystemWatcher();
    this.watcher.Path = path;
    this.watcher.NotifyFilter = NotifyFilters.LastWrite | NotifyFilters.FileName | NotifyFilters.DirectoryName;
    this.watcher.Filter = "*.xml";
    this.watcher.Created += new FileSystemEventHandler(OnCreated);
  }
  
  [EntryPoint]
  private void OnCreated(object source, FileSystemEventArgs e)
  {
     // Without [EntryPoint], the following line would throw ThreadAccessException.
     this.files.Add(e.FullPath);
  }
   
   public ICollection Files { get { return this.files; } }
   
 }
```
