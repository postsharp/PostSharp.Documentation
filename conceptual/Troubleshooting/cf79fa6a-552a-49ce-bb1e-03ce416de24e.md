If PostSharp has been installed on your computer using the setup program but does not get executed, check that PostSharp is still inserted in MSBuild extension points.


## Manual Procedure

You need to do something in every directory that you find on your system in the following list:

* *C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\v2.0*
* *C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\v3.5*
* *C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\v4.0*
* *C:\Program Files\MSBuild\v2.0*
* *C:\Program Files\MSBuild\v3.5*
* *C:\Program Files\MSBuild\v4.0*
In these directories, locate the file *Custom.After.Microsoft.Common.targets*. 

* If the file *Custom.After.Microsoft.Common.targets* does **not** exist, create it: 
    ```xml
    <Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
                <Import Project="C:\Program Files\PostSharp 2.0\PostSharp.targets" 
                        Condition=" '$(DontImportPostSharp)' != 'True' "/>
              </Project>
    ```


* If the file *Custom.After.Microsoft.Common.targets* exists, just insert the `<Import ... />` line in the `<Project/>` element. 


## Automatic Procedure

Execute the program **PostSharp.Setup.exe** with the following command line: 

```none
PostSharp.Setup.exe install
```
