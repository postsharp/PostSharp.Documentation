|-----------|-------------|
| <xref:PostSharp> | This namespace of PostSharp. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Aspects> | This namespace provides the primitives of the PostSharp aspect-oriented framework, such as abstract aspect classes, aspect interfaces, and advise argument classes. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Aspects.Advices> | This namespace provides custom attributes that allow developing composite aspects with advices and pointcuts. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Aspects.Configuration> | This namespace contains classes and custom attributes configuring the aspects of the PostSharp.Aspects namespace. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Aspects.Dependencies> | This namespace contains types and custom attributes that allow to define dependencies between aspects and advices, so that the aspect weaver behaves determistically even if the same element of code is the target of several aspects provided by multiple vendors. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Aspects.Serialization> | This namespace contains types taking care of the process of serializing aspects at build time and deserializing them at run time. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility> | This namespace defines the semantics of the attribute multicasting mechanism and exposes other types that allow user code to interact with the PostSharp,platform. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Reflection> | This namespace extends System.Reflection with new types to reflect the code model. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Collections> | This namespace contains collection types used by the <c>PostSharp</c> library. |

| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Caching.Backends.Redis> | This namespace contains an implementation of PostSharp.Patterns.Caching for Redis. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Caching.Dependencies> | This namespaces defines types that represent caching dependencies. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Caching.Formatters> | It seems this namespace contains just one type. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Caching.Implementation> | This namespace contains types that are useful when implementing an adapter for a caching back-end, but not when consuming the caching API. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Caching.Locking> | This namespaces implements the feature that can prevent concurrent execution of a cached method. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Caching.Serializers> | This namespace contains several serializers, whose role are to serialize cached objects into an array of bytes. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Caching.ValueAdapters> | This namespace contains the abstractions that allow to cache types like Stream or IEnumerable, which could not be cached without adaptation. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Collections.Advices> | This namespace defines the abstractions to define advices that can be dynamically added to advisable collections of the PostSharp.Patterns.Collections namespace. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Audit> | This namespace contains the abstractions for the audit feature, which is a special case of logging. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Backends> | This namespace is the base for all adapters for back-end logging frameworks. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Backends.ApplicationInsights> | This namespace contains the implementation of the Microsoft Application Insights logging back-end. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Backends.Audit> | This namespace contains the implementation of the audit logging back-end. |

| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Contexts> | This namespace implements different kinds of logging contexts. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom> | This namespace contains the implementation of the custom logging front-end API. It is generally not needed in user code.  It is normally not necessary to reference this namespace in user code, as the use of the <c>var</c> keyword is recommended. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.Messages> | This namespace contains the implementation of different message types used by the custom logging front-end API. It is normally not necessary to reference this namespace in user code, as the use of the <c>var</c> keyword is recommended. |

| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.RecordBuilders> | This namespace contains the implementations of record builders (a concept similar to a StringWriter). |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.ThreadingInstrumentation> | This namespaces contains aspects that instrument the System.Threading namespace. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.DynamicAdvising> | This namespace defines the abstractions for dynamically advisable classes, i.e. classes of objects into which behaviors can be injected at run time. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Formatters> | This namespace contains the implementation of formatters for values of different types. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.Controls> | This namespaces contains XAML controls for the undo/redo feature. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.TypeAdapters> | This namespace defines abstractions that allow to use the Aggregatable pattern with third-party types. |

| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Adapters.AspNetFramework> | This namespace allows you to instrument incoming HTTP requests with a legacy IIS-based ASP.NET application and PostSharp Logging. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Adapters.DiagnosticSource> | This namespace allows you to collect logs emitted by DiagnosticSource into PostSharp Logging. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Adapters.HttpClient> | This namespace allows you to instrument outgoing HTTP requests using PostSharp Logging. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Backends.Multiplexer> | This namespace allows to multiplex the output of PostSharp Logging to several back-ends instead of just one. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Transactions> | This namespace defines the abstractions for top-level logging transactions such as an incoming request. |
| <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Transactions.Model> | This namespace specifies the transaction configuration XML file and the classes and functions available to expressions. |
